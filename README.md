# User Registration Form

## 📌 Description
This project implements a **User Registration Form** using semantic HTML5.  
The form is designed to collect personal, contact, preference, and feedback details in a structured and accessible manner.

## 🎯 Purpose
The form is divided into sections:
1. **Personal Information** – Name, Date of Birth, Age, Gender, Profile Photo
2. **Contact & Address** – Email, Phone, Website, Address, City, Country, Postal Code, Contact Time
3. **Preferences & Interests** – Favorite Color, Experience Level, Birth Month, Available Week, Search Keywords, Interests, Education Level, Passwords
4. **Feedback & Additional Information** – Self-description, Suggestions, Registration Date & Time

## 📂 File Structure
## 🛠️ Implementation Notes
- HTML5 semantic elements (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<label>`) were used for clarity and accessibility.  
- Proper form input types (`email`, `url`, `date`, `time`, `month`, `week`, `search`, `color`, `range`, `file`) ensure correct validation.  
- Accessibility considered with **labels linked to inputs** via `for` and `id`.
